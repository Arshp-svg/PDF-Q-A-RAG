**PDF Q&A Chatbot using Groq, Langchain, and Streamlit**

This project implements a powerful PDF question-answering chatbot, utilizing Streamlit for the user interface, Langchain for document retrieval and processing, and Groq's LLM for natural language understanding. It allows users to upload PDF files, split them into smaller chunks, index them using FAISS vector store, and then ask questions based on the PDF contents. The chatbot provides precise answers by leveraging a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, combined with contextual chat history for more accurate responses.
